# English Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains an integrated English learning system designed to improve English proficiency at the B1/B2 level through three interconnected projects:

1. **D&D Project**: Immersive English practice through Dungeons & Dragons gameplay
2. **Assessment Project**: Formal evaluations to track progress against the B1/B2 syllabus
3. **Reinforcement Project**: Targeted exercises to address specific areas of improvement

## Project Philosophy
This learning system is built on the following principles:
- **Immersive Learning**: Using engaging contexts to practice English naturally
- **Systematic Tracking**: Monitoring errors and progress methodically
- **Targeted Reinforcement**: Creating specific exercises for areas that need improvement
- **Integrated Approach**: Connecting fun activities (D&D) with formal assessment and focused practice

## How The System Works

### Learning Cycle
1. **Identify** language challenges during D&D gameplay
2. **Assess** proficiency formally through themed assessments
3. **Reinforce** specific areas through targeted exercises
4. **Apply** improved skills in the D&D campaign

### Project Interaction
- D&D sessions generate error data and learning opportunities
- Assessment project evaluates progress against the B1/B2 syllabus
- Reinforcement project creates targeted practice for weak areas
- All projects share the error tracking system and syllabus

## Getting Started

1. Review the B1/B2 syllabus in the shared-resources folder
2. Begin with the D&D project by creating a character and starting a campaign
3. After several D&D sessions, take an assessment from the assessment project
4. Use reinforcement exercises to practice areas identified for improvement
5. Return to D&D to apply what you've learned

## Tools Used
- **Claude AI**: Used as both D&D Dungeon Master and English tutor
- **GitHub**: For version control and organization of learning materials
- **Custom prompts**: Designed for each project to optimize learning

## Progress Tracking
Progress is tracked through:
- The Error Tracking System (updated after each D&D session)
- Completed assessments (showing improvement over time)
- Reinforcement exercise results (documenting mastery of specific areas)
