  # English Assessment Project

## Project Purpose
This project provides structured language assessments to formally evaluate English proficiency at the B1/B2 level. It helps identify specific areas of strength and weakness, track progress over time, and guide further learning efforts.

## Assessment Philosophy
These assessments are designed to:
- Measure proficiency against the CEFR B1/B2 standards
- Evaluate both receptive (reading) and productive (writing) skills
- Provide detailed, constructive feedback
- Guide future learning through targeted recommendations

## Project Components

### Core Files
- **assessment-template.md**: Standard format for creating balanced assessments
- **assessment-library.md**: Catalog of all assessments with performance metrics
- **assessment-feedback-template.md**: Structured format for detailed feedback
- **assessment-creation-guide.md**: Guidelines for creating effective assessments

### Assessment Structure
Each assessment follows this standard format:
1. **Vocabulary Section** (25 points): Word definitions, fill-in-the-blanks, word formation

3. **Reading Comprehension** (20 points): Text analysis with various question types
4. **Writing Section** (25 points): Structured writing task with clear assessment criteria

### Feedback Components
After each assessment, detailed feedback is provided, including:
- Section-by-section score breakdown
- Specific strengths identified
- Areas for improvement
- Suggested next steps and resources
- Comparison to previous assessments (when applicable)
