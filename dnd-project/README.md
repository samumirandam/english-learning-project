# D&D English Learning Project

## Project Purpose
This project combines Dungeons & Dragons gameplay with English language learning at the B1/B2 level. It creates an immersive environment where English is used naturally while receiving gentle corrections and guidance.

## How It Works
In this project, Claude AI serves dual roles:
1. **Dungeon Master**: Creating engaging fantasy scenarios, managing NPCs, and facilitating gameplay
2. **English Tutor**: Identifying language errors, providing corrections, and introducing new language concepts

## Project Components

### Core Files
- **global-instructions.md**: Master prompt that defines Claude's role and approach
- **character-sheet.md**: Your D&D character with both game information and language learning goals
- **campaign-setting-log.md**: Record of the campaign world and session history

### Session Process
Each D&D session follows this structure:
1. **Pre-Session**: Brief review of language goals and previous errors
2. **Main Adventure**: Interactive storytelling with English immersion
3. **Post-Session**: Error analysis and language point summary

### Game Mechanics
- Uses `Math.random()` function for dice rolls
- Simplified D&D 5e rules for accessibility
- Balance between combat, exploration, and social interaction

## Language Learning Integration
- **Progressive Introduction**: Grammar and vocabulary from the B1/B2 syllabus are gradually introduced
- **Contextual Learning**: New language points appear naturally in the story
- **Error Tracking**: All errors are documented in the Error Tracking System
- **End-of-Session Analysis**: Summary of errors with corrections and explanations

## Using This Project

### Starting a New Session
1. Create a new chat with Claude
2. Refer to the global instructions document
3. Provide a brief recap or reference to the previous session
4. Begin role-playing in English

### Between Sessions
1. Review the Error Tracking System updates
2. Study any vocabulary or grammar points highlighted
3. Consider how to incorporate language goals into your character's actions

### Recommended Session Frequency
- 1-2 sessions per week for optimal learning
- Each session approximately 30-60 minutes
- Review errors and vocabulary between sessions

## Connection to Other Projects
- **Assessment Project**: After several D&D sessions, take an assessment to measure progress
- **Reinforcement Project**: Use targeted exercises to practice difficult areas identified in D&D

## Getting Started
1. Create your character using the character sheet template
2. Decide on a campaign setting with Claude
