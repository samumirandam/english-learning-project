### Overall Score: 5/17 (29%) - Needs Work

## Key Error Patterns

1. **Imperative structures in reported speech**:
   - Not using the structure: "tell/warn/advise + object + (not) to + infinitive"
   - Example error: "The alchemist warned to be careful" instead of "The alchemist warned me to be careful"

2. **Reported questions**:
   - Difficulties transforming question forms properly
   - Example error: "The apprentice asked for these task" instead of "The apprentice asked what these tasks were"

3. **Pronoun changes**:
   - Not adjusting pronouns consistently in reported speech
   - Example error: "The paladin asked if you would join" instead of "The paladin asked if I would join"

4. **Tense backshifting**:
   - Inconsistent application of tense changes
   - Example error: "when the moon is full" instead of "when the moon was full"

5. **Verb form accuracy**:
   - Issues with verb forms in reported structures
   - Example error: "would revealed" instead of "would reveal"

## Recommendations for Further Practice

### High Priority Areas:
1. Reported imperatives/commands (using tell/warn/advise + object + to-infinitive)
2. Pronoun adjustments in reported speech
3. Tense backshifting rules and application

### Suggested Follow-up Exercises:
- Focused practice on transforming imperatives into reported speech
- Exercises specifically on pronoun changes in reported speech
- Gap-fill exercises on tense backshifting

### D&D Integration Opportunities:
- Practice reporting NPC commands in character journal entries
- Transform direct dialogue from D&D sessions into reported speech
- Create mission reports using reported speech structures

## Next Steps
1. Complete follow-up exercises focused specifically on reported imperatives
2. Review basic rules for reported speech with emphasis on pronoun changes
3. Practice identifying which verbs require tense backshifting
4. Re-attempt similar exercises after focused practice
