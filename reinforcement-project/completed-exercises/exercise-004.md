### D&D Integration Opportunities:
- Create character journal entries reporting conversations with NPCs
- Practice reporting conversations between other party members to a third party
- Use reporting structures when conveying information from NPCs to the party

## Next Steps
1. Additional practice with statement word order in reported questions
2. Expanded practice with a wider variety of reporting verbs
3. Mixed exercises combining all types of reported speech
4. Contextual application in the D&D campaign
