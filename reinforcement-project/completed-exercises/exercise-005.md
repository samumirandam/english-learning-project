### Free Production
Successfully wrote a paragraph about an innkeeper's morning routine using 6 vocabulary words (eager, jays, porridge, chuckles, stirs, nods):

```
The innkeeper wakes up eager with the sound of jays, she starts the fire and put everything she has in a bag to make a porridge.

It's a gramma trick, "You put meal, spicies, oat, salt and the secret ingredient in a bag the night before" she always said.

She cleans the tables and glasses, usually she chuckles when remembered the events of the last night.

She stirs the porridge and tastes and puts some basil or another spicy. She nods when everything is good.
```

## Identified Error Patterns
1. **Verb tense consistency** in narratives (G015)
   - Example: "she starts the fire and put everything"
   - Correction: "she starts the fire and puts everything"

2. **Omitting subject pronouns** in dependent clauses (G016)
   - Example: "when remembered the events"
   - Correction: "when she remembered the events"

3. **Confusion between adjective/noun forms** (V009)
   - Example: "another spicy"
   - Correction: "another spice"

## Overall Assessment
