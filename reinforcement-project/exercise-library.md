## Exercise Creation Guidelines

### Principles
1. Always contextualize exercises (ideally using D&D campaign themes)
2. Include a mix of recognition and production tasks
3. Provide clear examples before exercises
4. Include comprehensive answer keys with explanations
5. Create connections to real-world language use

### Spaced Repetition Schedule
- Initial reinforcement: Immediately after error identification
- First review: 2-3 days later
- Second review: 1 week later
- Third review: 2 weeks later
- Final review: 1 month later

## Integration with Other Projects

### D&D Campaign Integration

- Character-specific language challenges

### Assessment Connection
- Pre-assessment practice
- Post-assessment reinforcement
- Progress measurement
