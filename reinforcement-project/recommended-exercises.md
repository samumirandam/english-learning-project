## Key Focus Areas for Immediate Practice

### Reported Speech Structures
Based on today's exercise results, it's recommended to break down reported speech practice into smaller, more focused components:

1. **Reported Commands/Imperatives**: Focus exclusively on the structure "tell/warn/advise + object + (not) to + infinitive"
2. **Reported Questions**: Practice separately with yes/no questions and wh-questions
3. **Pronoun Changes**: Targeted practice on adjusting pronouns appropriately in reported speech
4. **Tense Backshifting**: Systematic practice with each tense transformation

## D&D Integration Suggestions

For your next D&D session, consider these specific language practice opportunities:

1. Create a mission report where your character needs to report:
   - Commands given by NPCs (using reported imperatives)
   - Questions asked by NPCs (using reported questions)
   - Information shared by NPCs (using reported statements with backshifting)

2. Keep a character journal with entries specifically focused on reporting conversations using correct structures

This focused approach should help address the specific challenges identified in today's exercise.
